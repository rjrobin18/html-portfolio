<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Data Scientist working for the past 6 years. I have started to build the web pages using HTML. This is the
  website which demonstrates my efforts. This is the starting baby steps I am taking and I intent to improve this.
</p>

<p>I came across building of the web interface as there was a growing requirements of UI. Now data Scientist/AI Engineers need to display
  the results or the Agents response in an interactive User interface and there is a growing demand for AI engineers or Data 
  Scientist to know the HTML, CSS and React interface.
</p>

<p>Still evolving as proper UI Engineer.</p>
